    "\n",
    "- [ ] Being a lightweight option of RAG, with just the necessary dependencies. \n",
    "- [ ] Focused on RAG with local and open source models, not focused on API calls. \n",
    "- [ ] Try out different strategies and data-structures that can be used to have better results. (Such as dataframes, can try out with polars as its really performant)\n",
    "- [ ] Multimodal support, combine image, text and audio to get the best results\n",
    "- [ ] Solve some of the storage challenges RAG faces, and provide good solutions for updating documents and embeddings as well as loading them.\n",
    "- [ ] Use it as a educational library to demostrate on some of the main concepts llama-index or other RAG framworks use. \n",
    "- [ ] The base for the implementation of some agentic strategies I will try out on other library.\n",
    "- [ ] Offer support for local models with CPU like llama-cpp "
